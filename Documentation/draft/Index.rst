Documentation drafts
====================

Here, documentation can be written without making it official (yet).

.. warning::

   T3DocTeam manual is public.

   If should be excluded by https://docs.typo3.org/robots.txt

   **New:** A better solution may now be to use the 
   `documentation-draft <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/team-t3docteam/draft/en-us/>`__ branch.
