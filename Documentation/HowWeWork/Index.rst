Using Forge
===========

"What's new?" file archive
   The `documentation subproject "What's new?" at Forge
   <https://forge.typo3.org/projects/documentation-whatsnew>`__
   is used to ① provide a description, to ② list the people involved and,
   most important, to ③ keep a `file archive of all existing PDF files
   <https://forge.typo3.org/projects/documentation-whatsnew/files>`__
   in various languages.

   The slides (pdf files) are advertised on typo3.org with urls pointing
   to their Forge location:
