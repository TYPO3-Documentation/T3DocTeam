==============================================================
Information About Writing Documentation and Documentation Team
==============================================================


This page is used to clarify for the listed manuals and webpages:

Scope? What is it about? What is the target group? **What should be documented where?**

 - :Manual:       Manual
   :Scope:        About
   :State:        State, is it up-to-date?
   :NextStep:     Next step
   :Comment:      Comment

 - :Manual:       :ref:`h2document:start` (Guide)
   :Scope:        Main documentation for writing documentation on docs.typo3.org,
                  for contributors, extension developers (and Documentation Team).
   :State:        Reviewed and up to date!
   :NextStep:
   :Comment:      Use this as main resource for contributors!


 - :Manual:       :ref:`start` (this manual)
   :Scope:        Information *for* doc team. (In comparison:
                  `team page on typo3.org <https://typo3.org/community/teams/documentation/>`__
                  is *about* team.)
   :State:        In progress
   :NextStep:
   :Comment:      This can be used for things that only concern documentation team. It can
                  also be used for drafts. As information matures, it may get moved either to
                  team page on typo3.org or to "Writing Documentation".


 - :Manual:       Team page on **typo3.org**: https://typo3.org/community/teams/documentation/
   :Scope:        About the "Documentation Team" for interested public. Contains "official,
                  general information". WIP and internal information should be put in :ref:`start`
                  (this manual)
   :State:        In progress
   :NextStep:
   :Comment:      It's important for interested contributors to find relevant information.
                  Place strategic links on team page about contribution, joining Slack and
                  joining the team. The public should also have the possibility to inform
                  themselves about what team is doing.


 - :Manual:       "About TYPO3 Documentation" on "glue pages" https://docs.typo3.org/About.html
   :Scope:        Contains documentation news, Tips & Tricks ...
   :State:        Up to date
   :NextStep:
   :Comment:      :ref:`h2document:start` now being used as main resource for contributors.
                  In order to not have information in too many different places, the pages
                  "Contribution" and "Writing Documentation" have been replaced by external
                  links to :ref:`h2document:start`.

 - :Manual:       "Tips" on "start page" https://docs.typo3.org/
   :Scope:        **Changed:** Mostly tips about **using** (reading) documentation and
                  **general tips about TYPO3 or where to find things**!
   :State:        Up to date
   :NextStep:
   :Comment:      "Writing Documentation" now being used as main resource for contributors.
                  Because of this, the **tips on writing** documentation have been moved to
                  :ref:`h2document:start` (see startpage).


 - :Manual:       Forge Wiki: https://forge.typo3.org/projects/team-docteam
   :Scope:        This is currently only a placeholder for the
                  `slack call notes <https://forge.typo3.org/projects/team-docteam/wiki/index>`__.
                  Provide miminal information on that page and link elsewhere.
                  Could be removed if we did not still need the slack call notes and other notes.
   :State:
   :NextStep:
   :Comment:      todo: move "responsibilities of documentation team" to
                  `team page on typo3.org <https://typo3.org/community/teams/documentation/>`__
