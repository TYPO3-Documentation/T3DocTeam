 - :Manual:       Manual
   :Mentor:       Maintainer
   :State:        State
   :InProgress:   In progress
   :NextStep:     Next Step

 - :Manual:       :ref:`t3l10n:start`
   :Mentor:
   :State:        **outdated** Current "latest" is for version 7.6
   :InProgress:
   :NextStep:     Create branch for 7.6 and update "latest" for TYPO3 9. Also check, if there is overlap with other manuals. Should this manual be merged to "TYPO3 Explained"?

 - :Manual:       :ref:`t3install:start`
   :Mentor:
   :State:        **good** Generally, "latest" (9.5) version looks good and up-to-date.
   :InProgress:
   :NextStep:

 - :Manual:       :ref:`t3security:start`
   :Mentor:       Michael Schams
   :State:        Merged into TYPO3 Explained
   :InProgress:
   :NextStep:

   :Mentor:       Michael Schams
   :State:        "master" is for TYPO3 8.7

 - :Manual:       :ref:`t3extbasebook:start`
   :Mentor:
   :State:        **needs revision** Was often mentioned, that it is not up-to-date. Was also mentioned,
                  that language needs improvement.
   :InProgress:   Language improvements, roughly check if up-to-date (Sybille - May, 2019)
   :NextStep:     Decide if all branches should be maintained longterm or only "latest". Possibly,
                  remove other branches from being rendered (branches can be kept but will not
                  be rendered). Review for: up-to-date, proofread language.

 - :Manual:       :ref:`t3extbase:start`
   :Mentor:
   :State:        **needs revision** Scope of Guide unclear.
   :InProgress:
   :NextStep:     Make decision about guide. Should we continue maintaining it? What is scope?
                  How should it be structured? Should Fluid section be separated?

   :Mentor:       Sybille Peters
