   :NextStep:     Create branch for 7.6 and update "latest" for TYPO3 9. Also check, if there is overlap with other manuals. Should this manual be merged to "TYPO3 Explained"?

   :Mentor:
   :State:        **needs revision** Was often mentioned, that it is not up-to-date. Was also mentioned,

   :InProgress:   Language improvements, roughly check if up-to-date (Sybille - May, 2019)
   :NextStep:     Decide if all branches should be maintained longterm or only "latest". Possibly,
                  remove other branches from being rendered (branches can be kept but will not
                  be rendered). Review for: up-to-date, proofread language.
