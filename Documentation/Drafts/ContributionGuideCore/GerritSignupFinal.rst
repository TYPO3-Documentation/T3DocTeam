001 Setting up your Gerrit account (with-shadow)
================================================

1. Switch to new UI in Gerrit

      :class: with-shadow

   Head over to `Gerrit <https://review.typo3.org>`__, scroll to the bottom
   of the page and click the link "New UI". You can also work with the old
   UI, but then some things will look a little different.


2. Click the **Sign In** button in the top right corner.

   You will be prompted with a regular **Basic Authentication** window,
   simply enter your TYPO3.org username and password you had
   :ref:`set up earlier <TYPO3Account>`.


3. Create your ssh key

   If you don't know how to create your SSH Public/Private Key,
   we have compiled a list of links for you:

   * :ref:`OS X <ssh-key-osx>`
   * :ref:`Microsoft Windows <ssh-key-win>`
   * :ref:`Linux/Unix <ssh-key-unix>`


4. Add your public SSH key to Gerrit

      :class: with-shadow

   * Click on your profile in the top right corner and click **Settings**.

   * On the left hand side, click **SSH Keys**.

   * Copy-paste the contents of your public ssh key file (e.g.
     :file:`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) into the text field next to **New SSH key** and
     then click on **Add new SSH key**.

If you work with different computers, for example with a notebook
at work and another computer at home you can either copy your
private key or create a separate key for the other computer. Luckily
Gerrit can handle multiple keys.

Always keep your keys private. Never give them away. No member of the
TYPO3 project will ever ask you for your keys.
