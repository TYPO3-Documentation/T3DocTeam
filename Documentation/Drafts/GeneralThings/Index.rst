General things
==============

Here are some drafts for general things that concern all manuals.

Some more open questions:

* Is it possible to visually style various kinds of links and make differences recognizable, e.g.

  * external links / links in this manual / links in other manuals
  * additional information that is nice to have / mandatory information, that you should read first
