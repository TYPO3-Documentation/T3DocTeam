You will be prompted with a regular **Basic Authentication** window, simply enter your TYPO3.org username and password you
had :ref:`set up earlier <TYPO3Account>`.

.. note::

   Once you are logged into Gerrit_, you can start to make yourself familiar with the interface. Don't worry if it looks
   intimidating at first, you'll be a **Pro** with it in no time.

Adding your SSH key
===================

All communication with Gerrit_ works via SSH, so you will need to set up your public key to work.
Click on your profile in the top right corner and click **Settings**.

On the left hand side, click **SSH Public Keys** to set up your key.

.. note::

   If you work with different computers, for example with a notebook at work and another computer at home you can either
   copy your private key or create a separate key for the other computer. Luckily Gerrit_ can handle multiple keys.

.. important::

   Keep your keys private. Never give them away. No member of the TYPO3 project will ever ask you for your keys.

Click **Add Key** to add your new key and paste your key into the textbox below.
