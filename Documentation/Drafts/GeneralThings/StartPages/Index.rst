====================
DRAFTS for startpage
====================

What should be on the start page?

Some examples:

* What's the manual about (short description)
* Target audience (e.g. Developers)
* Prerequisites (what knowledge do you need, what to read first)
* Recommended reading (or should this be in the introduction section?)
* How to read this document (or should this be in the introduction section?)
* Quick links

What information is already in left sidepanel, on footer etc. and must not be in main content

* Title of document (is in left sidepanel)
* Version of document (is in left sidepanel)
* Copyright (is in footer)
* Author : documentation team (is in footer)
* Rendered : is in footer

How should the start page be styled?

* Each text block should be visibly recognizable
* Every manual should have a similar start page
