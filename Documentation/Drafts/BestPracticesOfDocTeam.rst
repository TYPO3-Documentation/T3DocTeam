.. include:: ../Includes.txt

DRAFT: Best practices of documentation team
===========================================

Use .rst.txt as suffix for included files
=========================================

Here's why: https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/Incoming/Index.html?highlight=include#including-files

Also, be careful if a file is included more than once, that the section level header formatting (====, ----
etc.) must be correct for all cases. (see TCA for examples)


Merge pull requests if possible
