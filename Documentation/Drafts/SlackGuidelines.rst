Draft: Slack Guidelines
=======================

Some ideas:

* Hints for new users (new Slack users / new TYPO3 users)

* Conventions for naming channels (cig-, Extension names, typo3-, Core contribution initiatives, common name for TYPO3 camps, user groups, etc.)
* Hints for creating a new channel 

   * e.g. At least fill out Channel purpose

* Hints for closing channels (some channels are dead, with no activity for months, there is even one where someone created a channel and then left it leavin 0 members etc.)

   * e.g. notify @channel with notification that the channel will be deleted
   * wait a week and give them chance to speak up?
   * @ mention an admin with suggestion to delete / archive
