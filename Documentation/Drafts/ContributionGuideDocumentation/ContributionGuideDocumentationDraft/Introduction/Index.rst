Introduction
============

Overview
========

This guide will walk you through the basics you need to make changes
to the official TYPO3 documentation on `docs.typo3.org
<https://docs.typo3.org>`__

With the Github user interface, the changes are made very easily.
We will explain everything step by step and if you need help,
there is a Slack channel **#typo3-documentation**.

Intended Audience
=================

You don't have to be a developer to contribute to the documentation.
You also don't need to be a TYPO3 expert. You can fix grammar,
spelling and style if you find something that needs improving.

Help on the documentation is very much appreciated.

Further recommended reading
===========================

Slack
=====

If you wish to contribute to the docs and have questions or run into
problems, the `TYPO3 slack workspace <https://typo3.slack.com>`__
is the place to be.

Slack is currently the main communication medium for TYPO3. In order
to join the slack workspace, you must `Register for TYPO3's Slack
Platform <https://forger.typo3.com/slack>`__. On that page, you will
also find information about the most important channels.

The channel **#typo3-cms-documentation** is your channel of choice
for everything concerning the docs. If you have some general TYPO3
support issues, please use **#typo3-cms** for that. If you are not
sure which channel to use for your question you can use **#random**
where you get direct help or a hint for the right channel.

.. hint::
   Do not ask if you can ask a question. Ask your question directly.


As always, regard the general `Code of conduct
<https://typo3.org/community/code-of-conduct/>`__ for TYPO3.

Other ways to contribute
========================

Besides contributing to the documentation, there are many other ways to
contribute and help the TYPO3 community.
