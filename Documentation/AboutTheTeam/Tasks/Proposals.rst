Proposals
=========

[PROPOSAL] One Person as mentor for each manual
===============================================

We already have this in an informal way with Lolli taking
care of Core API, for example. But, in general it might be
a good idea if we have one person who feels a little
responsible for each manual.

Would require to get more people involved.

[PROPOSAL] Use decisions
========================

Ask in decisions what people want for the manuals.

Start with a very specific question to keep discussion
focused.

.. _tasks-proposals-command-shortcuts:

[Proposal] Command shortcuts for docker
=======================================


**New** : The `docker image <https://github.com/t3docs/docker-render-documentation>`__
is very useful and convenient to use. To make it even easier to use, some suggestions:

* Windows support? (does the current method of source'ing the command into
  the shell work on windows? Can we make the method portable?
* more command shortcuts, for example for opening the generated html in
  the browser:
  `xdg-open "file:///$(pwd)/Documentation-GENERATED-temp/typo3cms/drafts/project/0.0.0/Index.html`
* can we put some basic commands (for example the `xdg-open`) into the
  docs repo itself (like TYPO3 does in a Build folder)? General commands should
  be maintained as 1 central repo (e.g. as a submodule).

See also pending review for inspiration:
`"#54959: Add various Composer scripts" <https://review.typo3.org/54959>`__

.. _tasks-proposals-startpage:

[PROPOSAL] Encourage Devs to join Docs team
===========================================

There are some technical tasks that are both interesting for developers
and challenging that maybe we could use help with (search engine,
streamline rendering workflow, ...).

Can we use some of these tasks to interest some developers to join the team
or help without becoming a member? That way they will be familiar with docs
and might be more inclined to add to the documentation as well.

To some, just documenting may not sound so interesting. This way, we
find a way to get them interested.


[PROPOSAL] Create an up-to-date startpage with list of main ressources
======================================================================

**This proposal is WIP ...**

Currently we have:

`Guides and Tutorials <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/GuidesAndTutorials/Index.html>`__

and


`References <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/References/Index.html>`__

Are the things that are listed here up to date and useful?

First, we need an overview what we actually have and in what state
it is in, see also: :ref:`overview-of-manuals`
