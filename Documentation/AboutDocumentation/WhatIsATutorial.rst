-  `What nobody tells you about documentation
   <https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/>`__ - a very good blogpost about 
   different kind of manuals by Daniele Procida, May 19, 2017
   
   Citation:
   
      Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps 
      to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs in order to 
      show a beginner that they can achieve something with it.
      
      They are wholly **learning-oriented**, and specifically, they are oriented towards 
      learning how rather than learning that.
      
      *You* are the teacher, and you are *responsible* for what the student will do. Under 
      *your* instruction, the student will execute a series of actions to achieve some *end*.
      
      The end and the actions are up to you, but deciding what they should be can be 
      hard work. The end has to be meaningful, but also achievable for a complete beginner.

      Consider an analogy of teaching a child to cook.

      What you teach the child to cook isn’t really important. What’s important is that 
      the child finds it enjoyable, and gains confidence, and wants to do it again.

      Through the things the child does, it will learn important things about cooking. 
      It will learn what it is like to be in the kitchen, to use the utensils, to handle 
      the food.

      This is because **using software, like cooking, is a matter of craft.** It’s knowledge - 
      but it is practical knowledge, not theoretical knowledge. When we learn a new craft 
      or skill, we always begin learning it by doing.

      The important thing is that having done the tutorial, the learner is in a position 
      to make sense of the rest of the documentation, and the software itself.

      Most software projects have really bad - or non-existent - tutorials. Tutorials are
      what will turn your learners into users. **A bad or missing tutorial will prevent your 
      project from acquiring new users.**

      Good tutorials are very difficult to write. They need to be useful for the beginner,
      easy to follow, meaningful and extremely robust.
