What Is A Tutorial?
===================

Characteristics of a TYPO3 tutorial
===================================

From looking at the literature mentioned below we start with some key points:

   a tutorial is a lesson, learning oriented, showing steps to complete something,
   making the reader more knowledgable
   
   the reader should achieve something meaningful and experience success, find it
   doable and enjoyable, enhance competence, gain confidence, and wants to do it again.
   
   concentrate on practical knowledge, not theoretical knowledge. Learn a new craft or skill, 
   concentrate on leraning by by doing

Guidelines:

   allow the user to learn by doing,
   
   go from simple to complex
   
   Get the user started

   it's ok to show the steps the beginner understands best. "best practice" may be something different.
   How an experienced user would do it may be something different.
   
   The goal is to get the reader started, not to get them to a final destination.
   
   Make sure that your tutorial works!

   inspire the beginner’s confidence: in the software, in the tutorial, in the tutor and, of 
   course, in their own ability to achieve what’s being asked of them.

   Ensure the user sees results immediately
    
   The conclusion of each section of a tutorial, or the tutorial as a whole, must be a 
   meaningful accomplishment.
   
   Your tutorial must be reliably repeatable.

   Focus on concrete steps, not abstract concepts. The temptation to introduce abstraction is huge: resist!
   
   Provide the minimum necessary explanation
   
   Focus only on the steps the user needs to take

*  `What nobody tells you about documentation
   <https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/>`__ - a very good blogpost about 
   different kind of manuals by Daniele Procida, May 19, 2017
   
   Citation:
   
      Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps 
      to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs in order to 
      show a beginner that they can achieve something with it.
      
      They are wholly **learning-oriented**, and specifically, they are oriented towards 
      learning how rather than learning that.
      
      *You* are the teacher, and you are *responsible* for what the student will do. Under 
      *your* instruction, the student will execute a series of actions to achieve some *end*.
      
      The end and the actions are up to you, but deciding what they should be can be 
      hard work. The end has to be meaningful, but also achievable for a complete beginner.

      Consider an analogy of teaching a child to cook.

      What you teach the child to cook isn’t really important. What’s important is that 
      the child finds it enjoyable, and gains confidence, and wants to do it again.

      Through the things the child does, it will learn important things about cooking. 
      It will learn what it is like to be in the kitchen, to use the utensils, to handle 
      the food.

      This is because **using software, like cooking, is a matter of craft.** It’s knowledge - 
      but it is practical knowledge, not theoretical knowledge. When we learn a new craft 
      or skill, we always begin learning it by doing.

      The important thing is that having done the tutorial, the learner is in a position 
      to make sense of the rest of the documentation, and the software itself.

      Most software projects have really bad - or non-existent - tutorials. Tutorials are
      what will turn your learners into users. **A bad or missing tutorial will prevent your 
      project from acquiring new users.**

      Good tutorials are very difficult to write. They need to be useful for the beginner,
      easy to follow, meaningful and extremely robust.
