How TYPO3 Documentation works
-----------------------------

- A short introduction.
- In general: Documentation of a project start at PROJECT/Documentation/Index.rst
- Index.rst is a plain textfile. Can be edited and versioned with the same tools as code.
- We are using a markup called *reStructuredText*
- Public documentation project reside at Github
- Can be edited by everyone through the "Edit me on Github" procedure.

Wiki: Benefits and Problems
---------------------------

- gives a quick start
- later on it's difficult for the authors to really improve
- there is no practical review and history
- for readers it's hard to decide what's still up to date

Plan about the Wiki
-------------------
- so the plan is to move Wiki content to Git-versioned Documentation projects
- watch this successful example:

  - https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/ContributionWorkflowGuide/
  - this had been in the Wiki before
  - mattes had this intermediate version:
    https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/drafts/


Demonstration
-------------
- Let me show you a practical example.
- At breakfast we talked about "Blueprints" in the Wiki
- https://wiki.typo3.org/Blueprints/
- https://wiki.typo3.org/Blueprints/composer.typo3.org
- https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/drafts/github/T3DocumentationStarter/Public-Info-045/
