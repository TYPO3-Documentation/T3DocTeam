     | in my world we have something like this:
     | registry of books, each rendering updates the metaData in the registry
     | from that registry we can then build views to guide readers
     | plus the rendering triggers the indexing of the Elasticsearch
     | plus a couple of other neat things like Tweets etc :smile:
